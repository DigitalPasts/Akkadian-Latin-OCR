# CuReD: Deep Learning Optical Character Recognition for Cuneiform Text Editions and Legacy Materials

This repository contains code for generating data and training OCR on Latin transliteration of Cuneiform texts trained on editions of Akkadian and Sumerian texts, using the [Kraken OCR](http://kraken.re/master/index.html) framework.

## Requirements

* [Kraken](https://github.com/mittagessen/kraken) installed as follows:

Clone the Kraken Github repo and install its Conda environment from within the repo with:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

Activating the kraken environment (`conda activate kraken`) gives access to the `kraken` and `ketos` command-line tools.

**Note:** If you want to fine-tune the model, you may want to use Kraken with CUDA (GPU acceleration). In this case you should instead install it with:

`conda env create -f environment_cuda.yml`

Note: This also creates an environment with name `kraken`. If you want both environments, edit the `.yml` file to change the environment name (e.g. to `kraken-cuda`).

## Usage Instructions

Activate the Kraken Conda environment and then run:

`kraken -i "IMAGE_FILENAME" OUTPUT_FILENAME binarize segment ocr -m MODEL_FILENAME`

Using the following values:
* IMAGE_FILENAME: Use the filename of the image you want to perform OCR on.
* OUTPUT_FILENAME: Filename of text file to write output to
* MODEL_FILENAME: Should point to the model file you want to use in `models/`

**Note:** In the output text, we use a single left curly brace { to indicate a superscript, which is significant in the common transliteration of Akkadian. We recommend to post-process by adding } after every character which is preceeded by {. For example, "{dAMAR.UTU" should be converted to "{d}AMAR.UTU".

## Models

The `models/` folder contains fine-tuned OCR models. We recommend `model.mlmodel` for general use. `dillard.mlmodel` was fine-tuned on typewriter text in Dillard (1975) and might perform better in that use case.

## Tests

In `tests/`, we have provided a sample paragraph (`test.png`, from Dietrich 2003) and OCR results of the default model in `output.txt`. You may run OCR on it and verify that you get the same output.

## Fine-Tuning Model

For instructions on fine-tuning the existing model on new data, see `Finetuning.md`.
